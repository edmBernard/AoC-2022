# AoC-2022

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). This year, I'm going to try doing the challenges in completly in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

- Github : [https://github.com/edmBernard/AoC-2022](https://github.com/edmBernard/AoC-2022)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:edmBernard/AoC-2022.git
cd AoC-2022
cargo build --release
```

The executable is named `AoC-2022`. Inputs path can be specified as argument or by default in the data folder.
